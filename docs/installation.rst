.. raw:: html

    <h3>1. Install using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a></h3>

.. code:: bash

    pip install django-salesman

.. note::

    Optionally install the `Pygments <https://pygments.org/>`_ library for a nicer code display in admin.
    You can use the command ``pip install django-salesman[pygments]``

    <h3>2. Add to your <code class="literal">settings.py</code></h3>

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'salesman.core',
        'salesman.basket',
        'salesman.checkout',
        'salesman.orders',
        'salesman.admin',

        'rest_framework',
    ]

.. raw:: html

    <h3>3. Add necessary urls in <code class="literal">urls.py</code></h3>

.. code:: python

    from django.urls import include, path

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        path('api/', include('salesman.urls')),
    ]

.. raw:: html

    <h3>4. Run the migrations and start server</h3>

.. code:: bash

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver

.. tip::
    It is recommended to configure and setup all Salesman models as swappable even if it's not necessary at the beginning.
    This will future-proof your application in case you wish to add it later.
    This has to be done before the initial migrations are created. See :ref:`swappable_models`.

**Done!** Salesman is installed and you can navigate the API by going to ``http://localhost:8000/api/``.
But since no product types are configured there is nothing to be added to the basket yet.
